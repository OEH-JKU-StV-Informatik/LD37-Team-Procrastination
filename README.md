# Theme of the challange, game idea
The theme is 'One room'.

Our game is inspired by tower defence games. The player has to slow down a the enemy - a grad student - to finish his studies in time. Therefore, he can place obstacles, e.g. walls and towers, that redirect or slow down the student on the field of knowledge.
